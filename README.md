# SideProject

When I have free time, I am working this project on a new topics to develop my talents. The backend of this application can be found here: 
https://github.com/side-projects-team/side-project-API

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Additional information

It should be noted that the backend is more advanced than the frontend. I'm now working on implementing an external login, for instance. Both the implementation and the functionality are not yet complete in Angular.

This readme file is also not quite complete. Once there is enough knowledge, this will be modified.
